# SimpleAACPBrowser

This is a simple Android Automotive app that will display a webview with a predetermined url. This is to support things like Carlinkit to enable CarPlay and Android Auto in vehicles that use AAoS but don't support those.

To adjust the url it opens adjust default_url in automotive/src/main/res/values/strings.xml.

This can be deployed to vehicles with the "internal testing" functionality of the Play store.
